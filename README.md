# ArchitectFrameworkNavigateComplexity
This is a talk I did for the TOGAF OpenGroup in JOhannesburg and Cape Town, South Africa: http://opengroup.co.za/event/ea-forum-johannesburg-20170830
Practicing Enterprise Architecture in any organisation is challenging due to the frequently changing market conditions in both the internal and external environments. Cloud, DevOps, continuous development and other elements add to the complexity that Architects need to navigate through. Thus, it is critical for Architects to use effective decision-making approaches that are adaptable and match the complexity of each situation.

Join Deven Gengan at this monthâ€™s EA Forum where he will share his knowledge and experience gained from complexity science. The session will assist Architects to execute in more adaptable ways and serve their organisations effectively.
